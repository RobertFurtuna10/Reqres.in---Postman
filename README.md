# Reqres.in-Postman

## 1. Introduction
#### Reqres simulates real application scenarios. If you want to test a user authentication system, Reqres will respond to a successful login/register request with a token for you to identify a sample user, or with a 403 forbidden response to an unsuccessful login/registration attempt.

## 2. Types available for testing
### HTTP methods supported by this API are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE 

## 3. Tests used for validation
- for this API no autenthication token is needed
- I send responses to all endpoints using all available HTTP methods
- the expected HTTP responses are received together with the HTTP messages following the requests.
- I wrote test-cases through which I validated the answer coming from the available templates that Postman offers.
